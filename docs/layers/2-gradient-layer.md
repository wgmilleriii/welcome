# Gradient Layer

## Purpose
Creates depth and atmosphere through dynamic color shifts that respond to scrolling.

## Characteristics
- Two gradient sets:
  1. Deep space (#001f3f → #003366)
  2. Night sky (#000033 → #000066)
- Parallax shift: 0.1-0.2
- Overlays mountain layer

## Behavior
- Gradients shift based on scroll position
- Creates illusion of depth through color transitions
- Responds to parallax movement

## Technical Notes
- Implemented using CSS gradients
- Smooth transitions between states
- GPU-accelerated animations
