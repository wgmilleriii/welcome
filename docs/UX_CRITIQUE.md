# UI/UX Critique and Improvement Suggestions

## Current Pain Points

### 1. Initial Load Experience
- **Issue**: Immediate audio controls visibility might be confusing when audio isn't playing
- **Issue**: No visual indication of scroll requirement to start interaction
- **Suggestion**: Add subtle scroll indicator animation
- **Suggestion**: Fade in audio controls only after first user interaction

### 2. Text Readability
- **Issue**: Spinning text might be difficult to read during rapid scrolling
- **Issue**: Text shadow might not provide sufficient contrast on all backgrounds
- **Suggestion**: Implement speed-based opacity adjustment
- **Suggestion**: Add dynamic contrast adjustment based on background

### 3. Control Placement
- **Issue**: Top-corner controls might be hard to reach on mobile
- **Issue**: Mountain controls at bottom might be obscured by mobile browsers' navigation bars
- **Suggestion**: Implement responsive control positioning
- **Suggestion**: Consider gesture-based controls for mobile

### 4. Interaction Feedback
- **Issue**: No visual feedback for successful mountain image switches
- **Issue**: Unclear when spinning is enabled/disabled
- **Suggestion**: Add transition animations for state changes
- **Suggestion**: Implement visual indicators for active states

### 5. Performance Concerns
- **Issue**: Continuous scroll event handling might affect performance
- **Issue**: Large background images might cause slow initial load
- **Suggestion**: Implement scroll throttling
- **Suggestion**: Add progressive image loading

### 6. Accessibility
- **Issue**: No keyboard navigation support
- **Issue**: Missing ARIA labels for dynamic content
- **Issue**: No reduced motion support
- **Suggestion**: Implement full keyboard control
- **Suggestion**: Add screen reader descriptions
- **Suggestion**: Honor prefers-reduced-motion

### 7. User Control
- **Issue**: No way to control text rotation speed
- **Issue**: Cannot pause at specific text combinations
- **Suggestion**: Add speed control slider
- **Suggestion**: Implement click-to-pause on specific text

### 8. Mobile Experience
- **Issue**: Parallax effects might be jarring on mobile
- **Issue**: Touch scrolling might interfere with text spinning
- **Suggestion**: Reduce effect intensity on mobile
- **Suggestion**: Add touch-specific interaction modes
