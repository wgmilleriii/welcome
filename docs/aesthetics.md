# Visual Aesthetics Guide

## Core Principles

### 1. Depth Through Motion
- Multiple parallax layers create spatial depth
- Offset movements suggest 3D space
- Gradient shifts enhance depth perception

### 2. Typography
- Clean, readable fonts
- Text remains legible during animations
- Shadow effects enhance visibility
- Spinning text maintains readability

### 3. Color Philosophy
- Base: Deep space blues
- Gradient transitions suggest atmosphere
- Black shadows for clarity
- White-to-scene transitions

### 4. Animation Timing
1. Audio controls fade in (0ms)
2. Mountain background fades from white (500ms)
3. Text elements appear (1500ms)
4. Spin controls fade in (2000ms)
5. Mountain controls fade in (2500ms)

### 5. Interactive Elements
- Minimal, intuitive controls
- Clear visual feedback
- Consistent positioning
- Smooth transitions

### 6. Responsive Behavior
- Maintains aesthetics across devices
- Adapts animations to screen size
- Preserves readability at all sizes

### 7. Performance Considerations
- Smooth animations prioritized
- Optimized asset loading
- GPU-accelerated where possible
- Efficient parallax calculations

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use CSS transforms for performance
- Implement requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Maintain 60fps target
- Progressive enhancement for older devices
