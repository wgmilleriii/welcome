# Mountain Experience üèîÔ∏è

## Latest Achievement: Multi-Layer Parallax! üéâ

We've successfully implemented a beautiful multi-layer parallax experience featuring:

### Dynamic Layers üåü
- Mountain background with subtle movement (-20%)
- Floating header text with fade effect
- Side panels with asymmetric speeds
- Elegant footer reveal

### Technical Highlights ‚ö°
- GSAP ScrollTrigger animations with variable speeds
- GPU-accelerated transforms for smooth performance
- Intelligent debug console with position tracking
- Responsive design with backdrop filters

### Interactive Elements üéÆ
- CTA buttons with hover effects
- Draggable debug console
- Smooth scroll animations
- Position-persistent interface

### Experience Versions üöÄ
- `index3.php`: Three-layer parallax with debug console
- `index4.php`: Enhanced version with refined animations

Special thanks to Jeanne for the inspiration and guidance! üí´

An immersive audio-visual journey combining classical music with interactive mountain landscapes.
